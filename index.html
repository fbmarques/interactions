          3) Type of intervention: Studies that do not describe or evaluate practices of reuse of research data made available in digital repositories, or that do not identify individual, social and technological factors that influence this reuse, will be excluded.<br>
          4) Outcomes: Studies that do not report outcomes relevant to the review, such as a description of the reuse of research data and the factors that influence this reuse, will be excluded.<br>
          5) Low-quality studies: Studies can be excluded on the basis of their methodological quality. For example, studies without a clear methodology, or with a high risk of bias, may be excluded.<br>
          6) Duplicate studies: If the same study is published in several places, only the most complete or most recent version will be included.<br>
          7) Non-primary studies: Studies that are based on secondary analyses of data (e.g. systematic reviews or previous meta-analyses) may be excluded to avoid overlap in data analysis.<br>
          8) Type of publication: Commentaries, editorials, opinions, letters, book notes, theoretical papers without empirical analysis, and documents without peer review, such as blog posts and newspaper reports.<br>
          9) Context of the study: Studies that are not carried out in academic or professional contexts, or that do not directly address the reuse of research data in digital repositories.<br>
          10) Aspects analyzed: Studies that do not address individual, social and technological factors that influence the reuse of research data.<br>
          11) Duplicate studies: If the same study is found in several sources, only the most complete or most recent version will be included.<br>
          12) Insufficient focus on research data reuse: Studies that mention research data reuse only tangentially, without in-depth analysis.<br>
          13) No access to the full text: If only the abstract or part of the study is available, it will be excluded, as it is not possible to adequately assess the relevance or quality of the study without the full text.<br>
          14) Insufficient data: Studies that do not provide sufficient or clear data on the reuse of research data, the factors that influence this practice, or both.<br>
          15) Low-quality studies: Studies that are methodologically weak or have a high risk of bias, based on a quality assessment tool such as the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Studies (QUIPS) or the Critical Appraisal Studies Checklist (CASP).<br><br>
          
          These criteria help ensure that you capture as much relevant literature as possible, while limiting the inclusion of studies that are not useful for answering your research question. Remember, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are specific to each systematic review and should be defined based on the research question and the objectives of the study. The most important thing is to be clear and consistent when applying these criteria. Remember that the inclusion and exclusion criteria should be refined as necessary during the systematic review. The literature review process is iterative and may require you to revise the criteria as you become more familiar with the literature. These additional criteria can help to further focus the systematic review on the research question, ensuring that the review is comprehensive and of high quality.

          Assessing the quality of the studies included in a systematic review is an essential step, but the tools used may vary depending on the area of study. Although the QUIPS and CASP tools are commonly used in systematic reviews in the health area, there are other tools that may be more suitable for studies in information science or other areas.<br><br>

          Some of these tools include:<br>
          1) Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields (Kmet, Lee, & Cook, 2004): This tool was developed to assess the quality of primary research studies from a variety of fields, not just health. It includes criteria for assessing quantitative and qualitative studies.<br>
          2) Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) Qualitative Checklist: Although CASP is often used in health studies, the qualitative checklist can be applied to studies in other disciplines that use qualitative methods.<br>
          3) Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT): This is a tool that can be used to assess the quality of studies that use mixed methods, which can be useful if you are including this type of study in your review.<br>
          4) Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN): Although it was developed for the health area, COSMIN has a set of checklists that can be useful for evaluating studies that use measurement instruments, which may be relevant in some information science studies.<br>
          5) Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI): The JBI offers a variety of evaluation tools for different types of studies, including experimental studies, observational studies, qualitative studies, case reports and case series, among others.<br><br>
          
          Remember that the choice of assessment tool should be guided by the type of studies included in your review and the nature of your research question.

          In the field of Information Science, tools for assessing the quality of studies are more diffuse, given the diversity of research methods used in the discipline, which can range from qualitative studies to quantitative studies and mixed-method studies. However, the following tools and approaches can be useful:<br>
          1) Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields (Kmet, Lee, & Cook, 2004): This tool is generic and can be applied to a variety of research fields, including Information Science. It provides separate criteria for evaluating quantitative and qualitative studies.<br>
          2) Checklist for Analyzing a Case Study (Avison & Malaurent, 2007): This checklist can be useful for evaluating case studies, a common research method in Information Science.<br>
          3) Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) Qualitative Checklist: Although CASP is often used in health studies, the qualitative checklist can be applied to qualitative studies in Information Science.<br>
          4) Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT): This tool can be used to assess the quality of mixed methods studies in Information Science.<br>
          5) Peer-review process itself: In many cases, studies in Information Science are evaluated through the peer-review process itself. In other words, if a study has been published in a peer-reviewed journal, this can be an indication of its quality.<br><br>
          
          It should be noted that the evaluation of the quality of studies in systematic reviews in Information Science is often less formalized than in some other disciplines, such as medicine. However, it is always important to be clear about how you will assess the quality of the studies in your review, and to apply these criteria consistently.

      To carry out a systematic literature review, you need to define a suitable search string for the databases you intend to use. This will allow you to refine your search and obtain results relevant to your research question.<br><br>
 
      Here is a suggested search string for your question:<br><br>
       
      ("data reuse" OR "data reutilization" OR "data reuse") AND ("academic contexts" OR "professional contexts" OR "academic context" OR "professional context") AND ("implementation" OR "implementation") AND ("digital repositories" OR "digital repositories") AND (("individual factors" OR "individual factors") OR ("social factors" OR "social factors") OR ("technological factors" OR "technological factors")).<br><br>
       
      Remember that you may need to adjust this string depending on the database you are using, as different databases may have different formatting requirements for search strings. It is also recommended that you consider equivalent terms in English and other languages relevant to your search, to ensure that you are collecting as much relevant literature as possible.<br><br>
       
      In addition, it is always a good idea to check the controlled descriptors (e.g. MeSH in PubMed) to ensure that you are using the correct terms for your search.

      Please note that Web of Science supports the use of parentheses to group search terms and the use of OR and AND to combine different groups of terms. Therefore, this search string will look for articles that contain at least one term from each group of terms.<br><br>
       
      In addition, you may want to adjust this search string depending on any specific requirements or restrictions of your systematic review, and you may want to consider using additional operators (e.g. NEAR) to further refine your search

      I apologize for the inconvenience. Formulating search strings for systematic reviews can be an iterative process that requires adjustments and refinements. Here is a slightly modified search string that may produce better results:<br><br>
 
      ("data reuse" OR "data reutilization" OR "data sharing") AND ("academic" OR "professional") AND ("implementation" OR "practice" OR "use") AND ("digital repositories" OR "data repositories") AND ("influencing factors" OR "determinants" OR "barriers" OR "facilitators").<br><br>
       
      This search string still addresses the main elements of your research question, but uses a wider range of terms that may be present in the relevant articles.<br><br>
       
      If this new string still doesn't produce satisfactory results, I would recommend discussing the issue with a librarian or health information specialist, if possible. They have specialized training and may be able to offer more specific guidance on formulating search strings for Web of Science or other databases.

      I apologize for the inconvenience. It may be that your search question is quite specific and therefore there aren't many articles that exactly meet the criteria set out in the search string.<br><br>
 
      However, you can try to address the problem in two ways:<br><br>
       
      Adjust the search string to make it less specific. For example, you could remove some of the less important criteria to increase the number of results. Here's an example of a broader search string:<br>
      ("data reuse" OR "data reutilization" OR "data sharing") AND ("academic" OR "professional") AND ("digital repositories" OR "data repositories").<br><br>
       
      Perform several searches with different search strings for each aspect of your research question. For example, you could do a search for "data reuse in academic and professional contexts", another for "implementation of data reuse", and so on. Then you can combine the results of these searches to answer your research question.<br>
      I hope these suggestions help, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. Formulating search strings for systematic reviews can be a challenging process and can sometimes require several attempts to get the desired results.

      Excellent! Glad to hear you found a search string that produced more useful results for your systematic review. Ten documents may not seem like a lot, but if they are highly relevant to your research question, they may be more than enough. Remember, the quality of the studies included in a systematic review is more important than the quantity.<br><br>
 
      Now, the next step is to assess these documents to determine whether they meet your inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic review. You should read the titles and abstracts of each document and, if they seem relevant, read the full document to confirm. You can then extract the relevant data from each included study and synthesize it to answer your research question.<br><br>
       
      Good luck with your systematic review! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask.

      6) This study explored the reuse of Video Records of Practice (VRPs) in educational settings, particularly how reuse goals and user experience levels impact selection criteria for VRPs. It found that researchers mainly use VRPs to examine education processes and improve measures in education. In contrast, educators tend to use VRPs to provide examples of teaching and learning. These different objectives lead to different expectations of VRPs, such as the amount of content required and the contextual information needed to support reuse.<br><br>
       
      7) The study examined the factors affecting psychologists' data sharing intentions and open data badge adoption. The results showed that the perceived benefits to the community, the norm of data sharing and the perceived effort to share datasets influence psychologists' intentions. In addition, reciprocity norm, Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements, and availability of data repositories affect data sharing intentions, while perceived academic reputation and risk impact open data badge adoption.<br><br>
       
      8) This article reported on a study that investigated data managers' perspectives on the evolution of Designated Communities and the FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) using an example of a geological repository. It was found that the Designated Community for the collection has evolved from users in the oil industry to include academic researchers and the public. The main factors driving these changes were technological developments.<br><br>
       
      9) This article addressed the challenges in accessing and reusing raw experimental research data, with a focus on human genomic data.

        6) Kim, Jihyun; Suzuka, Kara; Yakel, Elizabeth. Reusing qualitative video data: matching reuse goals and criteria for selection Purpose This research investigated the reuse of Video Records of Practice (VRPs) - i.e. a type of qualitative data documenting teaching and learning in educational settings. It studied how reusers' purposes and experience-level with VRP reuse influence the importance of various VRP selection criteria and how these differ depending on whether the main goal for reuse was research or teaching. It also examined whether two different dimensions of qualitative research - reflexivity and context - were factors in VRP reuse. Design/methodology/approach: The study reports on surveys of reusers at four VRP repositories. Questions were based on the literature and interviews with VRP reusers. The response rate was 20.6% (180 of 872 distributed surveys). This paper focused on 126 respondents who affirmatively responded they reused VRPs from a repository. Findings Researchers using VRPs were primarily interested in examining a broad range of processes in education and studying/improving ways to measure differences and growth in education. Reusers with teaching goals were commonly interested in VRPs to engage learners in showing examples/exemplars of - and reflecting on - teaching and learning. These differences between research and teaching led to varied expectations about VRPs, such as the amount of content needed and necessary contextual information to support reuse. Research limitations/implications While repositories focus on exposing content, understanding and communicating certain qualities of that content can help reusers identify VRPs and align goals with selection decisions. Originality/value Although qualitative data are increasingly reused, research has rarely focused on identifying how qualitative data reusers employ selection criteria. This study focused on VRPs as one type of qualitative data and identified the attributes of VRPs that reusers perceived to be important during selection. These will help VRP repositories determine which metadata and documentation meet reusers' goals. <br>
        7) Kim, Youngseek. A study of the determinants of psychologists' data sharing and open data badge adoption This research examines whether attitudinal, normative, and behavioural control factors affect psychologists' data sharing and open data badge adoption intentions. The results from the multivariate regression demonstrate that psychologists' (n = 338) data sharing and open data badge adoption intentions are commonly influenced by perceived community benefit, norm of data sharing, and perceived effort involved to share datasets. Additionally, psychologists' data sharing intentions are affected by additional, normative, and control factors including the norm of reciprocity, IRB requirements, and availability of data repositories. As it concerns open data badge adoption, psychologists are affected by additional attitudinal factors, including perceived academic reputation and risk. This research suggests psychologists' motivations to share data and for open data badge adoption differ, so different strategies are needed to better promote psychologists' data sharing and open data badge adoption. <br>
        8) Donaldson, Devan Ray; Zegler-Poleska, Ewa; Yarmey, Lynn. Data managers' perspectives on OAIS designated communities and the FAIR principles: mediation, tools and conceptual models Purpose This paper presents results of a study on data managers' perspectives on the evolution of Designated Communities and the FAIR Principles using an example of a geological repository. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed 10 semi-structured interviews with data managers at a state geological survey and qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts. Findings The Designated Community for a collection in this data repository has evolved from petroleum industry users to include academic researchers and the public. This change was accompanied by significant user interaction changes from in-person, reference interview-style conversations to anonymous digital, automated interactions. The main factors driving these changes were developments in technology which allowed the data managers to shift data discovery and access into the online environment. The online data portal has seen increasing non-expert use, driving the data team to develop additional services for these new communities. Repository data team participants varied in their familiarity with the FAIR Principles and their perceptions of the FAIRness of the data in the repository. Research limitations/implications: The study was limited to one organization in the United States. However, the results are applicable to other data environments working through the tensions between high-level globes frameworks such as FAIR, and continuing to serve the day-to-day needs of their designated communities. Continued work on how to assess success in this complex space is needed. Originality/value This paper lies at the nexus of two digital preservation frameworks and contributes to a limited extant literature providing guidance on implementing the concept of a Designated Community in practice. <br>
        9) Nielsen, Fiona; Kovalevskaya. Genome sharing projects around the world: how you find data for your research Access to raw experimental research data and data reuse is a common hurdle in scientific research. Despite the mounting requirements from funding agencies that the raw data is deposited as soon as (or even before) the paper is published, multiple factors often prevent data from being accessed and reused by other researchers. The situation with the human genomic data is even more dramatic, since on the one hand human genomic data is probably the most important data to share - it lies at the heart of efforts to combat major health issues such as cancer, genetic diseases, and genetic predispositions for complex diseases like heart disease and diabetes. On the other hand, since it is sensitive and personal information, it is often exempt from data sharing requirements. DNAdigest investigates the barriers for ethical and efficient genomic data sharing and engages with all stakeholder groups, including researchers, librarians, data managers, software developers, policy makers, and the general public interested in genomics. Repositive offers services and tools that reduce the barriers for data access and reuse for the research community in academia, industry, and clinics. To address the most pressing problem for public genomic data: that of data discoverability, Repositive has built an online platform (repositive.io) providing a single point of entry to find and access available genomic research data. <br>
        10) Prokosch, H. U.; Ganslandt, T. Perspectives for Medical Informatics Reusing the Electronic Medical Record for Clinical Research Objectives: Even though today most university hospitals have already implemented commercial hospital information systems and started to build up comprehensive electronic medical records, reuse of such data for data warehousing and research purposes is still very rare. Given this situation, the focus of this paper is to present an overview on exemplary projects, which have already tackled this challenge, reflect on current initiatives within the United States of America and the European Union to establish IT infrastructures for clinical and translational research, and draw attention to new challenges in this area. Methods: This paper does not intend to provide a fully comprehensive review on all the issues of clinical routine data reuse. It is based, however, on a presentation of a large variety of historical, but also most recent activities in data warehousing, data retrieval and linking medical informatics with translational research. Results: The article presents an overview of the various international approaches to this issue and illustrates concepts and solutions which have been published, thus giving an impression of activities pursued in this field of medical informatics. Further, problems and open questions, which have also been named in the literature, are presented and three challenges (to establish comprehensive clinical data warehouses, to establish professional IT L infrastructure applications supporting clinical trial data capture and to integrate medical record systems and clinical trial databases) related to this area of medical informatics are identified and presented. Conclusions: Translational biomedical research with the aim "to integrate bedside and biology" and to bridge the gap between clinical care and medical research today and in the years to come, provides a large and interesting field for medical informatics researchers. Especially the need for integrating clinical research projects with data repositories built up during documentation of routine clinical care, today still leaves many open questions and research challenges. Consideration of regulatory requirements, data privacy issues, data standards as well as people/organizational issues are prerequisites in order to vanquish existing obstacles.
